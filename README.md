# Unconditional social cash transfer (USCT)

This is a part of [GovStack Sandbox](https://govstack.gitbook.io/sandbox/). The use case profiles specifically the digital integration steps within the delivery journey of a generalized unconditional social cash transfer service. Unconditional cash transfers are cash payments provided to financially disadvantaged or vulnerable people or households without requiring anything in return (i.e. without conditionality).
